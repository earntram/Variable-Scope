What is scope? Your explanation should include the idea of global vs. block scope.
  Scope is what is allowed to be accessed
  Gobal is everywhere in the code
  Block only functions inside the specified code
  
Why are global variables avoided?
  Code becomes bug prone
  
Explain JavaScript's strict mode
  any time a variable is declared without the let or const keyword, an error will be triggered
  
What are side effects, and what is a pure function?
  A side effect is when a function reaches outside its local scope up into a parent scope and alters a value that lives there
  A function is said to be pure when it is both determinate and has no side effects.
